In this repository, I save a number of files that are primarily of use to myself. But, as knowledge should be shared, I will save these here.

In the file config.gateway.json I configure my KPN FTTH with added functionalities such as VLAN support for ipv6. Most of the work has been provided by CoolHVA (https://github.com/coolhva/usg-kpn-ftth).
